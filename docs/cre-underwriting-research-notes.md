# CRE Underwriting Research Notes
## Intelligence Gathered for Ultimate Underwriting Authority Tool

*Research Date: January 2025*

---

## 1. INSTITUTIONAL UNDERWRITING STANDARDS

### Regulatory Framework (OCC, FDIC, Federal Reserve)
- **12 CFR 208, subpart E** - Federal Reserve real estate lending standards
- **12 CFR Part 365** - FDIC Real Estate Lending Standards
- Key guidance: "Concentrations in CRE Lending, Sound Risk-Management Practices" (Dec 2006)

### Core Requirements
- Clear, measurable underwriting standards
- Feasibility studies for development/construction
- Sensitivity/risk analyses (interest rates, vacancy, OpEx)
- Minimum standards for: initial equity, net worth, cash flow, debt service
- Quantitative review: NOI, LTV, DSCR, debt yield, stress tests

### Common Deficiencies (Examiner Findings)
- Failing to monitor CRE portfolios properly
- Weak appraisal review programs
- Inadequate knowledge of lending markets
- Poor loan structuring
- Lack of effective construction oversight

---

## 2. KEY FINANCIAL METRICS & BENCHMARKS

### Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR)
- **Minimum**: 1.20x to 1.25x common
- **Riskier assets**: 1.30x+ expected
- **Target**: 1.25x to 1.35x for competitive deals
- **Best rates**: 1.25x+ generates $1.25 income per $1 debt

### Loan-to-Value (LTV)
- **Expectation**: 65%-75% in strong deals
- **Average market**: ~63%
- **Caution zone**: 55%-65% for higher risk
- **Banks**: 75%-80% for multifamily, 70%-75% other

### Debt Yield
- **Current requirements**: 7%-10%
- **CMBS historically**: 9%-10% minimum
- **Current CMBS**: ~7% (more flexible market)
- **High risk threshold**: Below 8% DYR
- **Typical lender requirement**: 8% minimum

### Cap Rate Spreads by Property Type (2025)
| Property Type | Cap Rate Range |
|--------------|----------------|
| Multifamily (Class A) | 4.5% - 5.5% |
| Industrial/Logistics | 5.0% - 6.5% |
| Cold Storage | 5.5% - 6.5% |
| Self Storage | 5.5% - 7.0% |
| Office (CBD Class A) | 6.0% - 7.5% |
| Retail (NNN) | 5.5% - 7.0% |

## 3. WATERFALL & PROMOTE STRUCTURES

### Industry Standard Preferred Returns
- **Most common**: 8% (40% of deals)
- **Second most common**: 10% (30% of deals)
- **7% pref**: ~8% of deals

### Common GP/LP Splits
- **Standard**: 70/30 LP/GP (after pref)
- **Tiered example**:
  - IRR 0%-8%: 90/10 LP/GP
  - IRR 8%-15%: 80/20 LP/GP
  - IRR 15%+: 50/50 LP/GP

### GP Catch-Up Mechanics
- Allocates profits to GP to ensure promote share equals target
- **100% catch-up**: All distributions to GP after pref until 20% of total profits
- **50/50 catch-up**: Split equally until GP catches up
- Without catch-up: GP receives 0% below hurdle, dramatically reducing GP economics

### After Catch-Up
- Typically 80/20 LP/GP split
- Some LPAs have tiered carry (escalates to 25% above 3x multiple)
