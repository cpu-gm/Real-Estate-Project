# Kernel UI

Phase 2A Next.js app. Run from the repo root with:

```powershell
npm run dev:ui
```

## UTF-8 hygiene
All source files must be UTF-8 encoded. Non-UTF encodings will fail Next.js builds.

## Phase 4 manual checklist
1) Create deal via UI landing and open Deal Home.
2) Confirm demo actors auto-seed (GP/LENDER/ESCROW).
3) Select a role, approve, add materials, and retry Finalize Closing until allowed.
4) Export Proof Pack from Deal Home or Playback.
